# Builds the ISO via debian-live's `lb` (live-build) tool.
#
# MUST run on a real Debian/Ubuntu Linux machine with live-build installed
# (`sudo apt-get install live-build`) — it uses debootstrap, chroot, and
# bind-mounts that don't exist on macOS, so there is no way to even
# syntax-check this beyond the contents of the scripts it copies in (those
# have already been checked separately with shellcheck). This script has
# NOT been run yet — see README.md status section.
#
# Usage: ./build.sh   (run from this directory: custom-linux-distro/iso/)
